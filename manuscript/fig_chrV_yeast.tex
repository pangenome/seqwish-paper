   \caption{
     Base-pair lengths of graphs built from 100 permutations of yeast chrV.
     Each point corresponds to the length of a graph built from a specific permutation and the given method.
     We color each point by the first genome in the order (the ``reference'' in \textit{minigraph}).
     A boxplot per first genome group provides the mean and the first and third quartile intervals for each reference grouping.
